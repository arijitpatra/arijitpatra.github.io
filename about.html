                    While I am not forced to do something I like to spend my time doing photography, meeting and talking with people, travelling, discovering new places, spending time with my laptop developing something, designing, strumming and trying to learn the guitar, watching or reading news, playing some racing games, cycling or having a plate of Biryani (the Kolkata style).
