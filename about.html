                    While I am not forced to do something I like to spend my time doing photography, meeting and talking with people, travelling, discovering new places, spending time with my laptop developing something, designing, strumming and trying to learn the guitar, watching or reading news, playing some racing games, cycling or having a plate of <kbd>Biryani</kbd>. 
                    <br> 
                    Some people were kind enough to give me the honors of 3 first prize, 3 second prize & 1 third prize in the field of photography. Plus, a third prize for quiz.
